description="MEF (Modular Event Framework) is a modular event system for Godot 4.

It allows you to build complex events composed of conditions and effects, executed in deterministic groups.

Features:

• Execution Groups (EARLY / MAIN / LATE / CLEANUP)
• Priority-based ordering
• Async effects (parallel inside group)
• Event cancellation support
• Shared execution context
• Node-based, editor-friendly architecture

This is the free core intended as a foundation for building reusable gameplay modules.

Early release (v0.1.0). Feedback welcome."
